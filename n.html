    <h1>The Rise of Electric Vehicles in India – A Common Man’s Insight</h1>

    <p>
        As a middle-class Indian from Kerala, I’ve seen our streets evolve from rickety autorickshaws to sleek electric scooters. The shift to <span class="highlight">Electric Vehicles (EVs)</span> isn’t just a trend; it’s a silent revolution. With rising fuel prices, environmental concerns, and government incentives, the dream of owning an EV is becoming real for many Indians like me.
    </p>

    <h2>Driving Change with Purpose</h2>

    <p>
        EVs offer more than clean energy – they provide hope for a cleaner, quieter, and smarter India. Brands like Tata, Ola, Ather, and MG are now household names in the EV sector.  
        More than a luxury, EVs are becoming a necessity for urban families dealing with daily commutes and rising costs.
    </p>

    <p>
        What struck me the most was the affordability factor. With the FAME II subsidy and state-level perks, EVs became attainable. Slowly, even my neighbors, once skeptical, began switching to electric scooters and bikes.
    </p>

            <td>Electric MPV</td>
            <td>520 km/charge</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Government's Role in EV Growth</h2>

    <p>
        One of the biggest enablers of this movement has been government support.  
        From charging infrastructure to tax reductions, the Indian government is actively paving the way for a greener future. The <span class="highlight">FAME-II scheme</span>, GST reduction, and road tax waivers have encouraged many to adopt EVs.
    </p>

    <p>
        Cities like Bengaluru, Delhi, and Kochi are becoming EV-friendly, with charging stations popping up at malls, petrol pumps, and even tea stalls.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges Along the Road</h2>

    <p>
        However, it's not all smooth sailing. Range anxiety, lack of charging infrastructure in rural areas, and higher initial costs still pose challenges. But if there’s anything we Indians are known for, it’s jugaad – we adapt and innovate.
    </p>

    <p>
        EV awareness campaigns and local entrepreneurship are helping bridge these gaps. Even local electricians are learning how to fix EV components now!

    <h2>Final Words</h2>

    <p>
        As an Indian citizen, I feel proud of the progress we’ve made in just a few years.  
        EVs aren’t just machines; they symbolize India’s push towards a smarter and greener tomorrow.
        So, if you're still on the fence about EVs, give them a thought – not just for yourself, but for the future of our planet.
